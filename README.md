This is example of data lineage 


Below are detailed descriptions for MachineLearningServerNode, OverrideNode, and ABTestNode based on how they might be used in a modular, node-based framework for a system like Photon. I'll include each node's functionality, purpose, and example code to clarify their roles.


---

1. MachineLearningServerNode

Definition:

The MachineLearningServerNode is a node type that connects to a machine learning server or model hosting service to fetch predictions. This node can be configured to call models like CatBoost, XGBoost, or any other hosted model. It typically passes specific features to the model and receives a prediction, which is then used in further computations.

Purpose:

Integrates external ML models: Allows the system to use machine learning models for dynamic predictions, such as risk scores, claim likelihood, or other factors impacting the final premium.

Adds flexibility: By connecting to a model server, new models can be deployed, updated, or replaced without changing the core system logic.


Example Code:

class MachineLearningServerNode:
    """
    Represents a node that connects to a machine learning server to retrieve predictions.

    Attributes:
        model_name (str): The name of the model hosted on the server.
        server_url (str): The URL endpoint of the model server.
    """

    def __init__(self, model_name, server_url):
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.server_url = server_url

    def predict(self, features):
        """
        Sends features to the model server to get a prediction.

        Args:
            features (dict): A dictionary of feature names and values.

        Returns:
            float: The predicted value from the model.
        """
        # Simulate a request to a model server (e.g., using HTTP requests)
        # response = requests.post(f"{self.server_url}/predict", json={"model": self.model_name, "features": features})
        # prediction = response.json()["prediction"]

        # For illustration, let's assume a mock prediction
        prediction = 0.8  # Mocked prediction value
        return prediction


# Example Usage
features = {
    "age": 35,
    "vehicle_type": "SUV",
    "region": "Urban"
}

ml_node = MachineLearningServerNode(model_name="risk_model", server_url="http://mlserver.com")
risk_score = ml_node.predict(features)
print(f"Predicted Risk Score: {risk_score}")

In this example, the MachineLearningServerNode sends the features dictionary to the model server, retrieves a risk score prediction, and outputs it for use in further calculations.

2. OverrideNode

Definition:

The OverrideNode allows for the modification or "override" of values within a computation, based on specified conditions. For example, if a particular rule or scenario is met (e.g., a high-risk customer), the OverrideNode will override the existing values with predefined adjustments.

Purpose:

Rule-based Overrides: Apply overrides when certain criteria are met, such as a special premium adjustment for high-risk customers.

Conditional Logic: Enable custom scenarios that alter standard computations without needing to change core calculations.


Example Code:

class OverrideNode:
    """
    Represents a node that overrides values based on specific conditions.

    Attributes:
        override_value (float): The value to override with when conditions are met.
        condition (callable): A function that defines the condition for applying the override.
    """

    def __init__(self, override_value, condition):
        self.override_value = override_value
        self.condition = condition

    def apply_override(self, value, context):
        """
        Applies the override if the condition is met.

        Args:
            value (float): The original value to potentially override.
            context (dict): A dictionary containing context for evaluating the condition.

        Returns:
            float: The overridden or original value, depending on the condition.
        """
        if self.condition(context):
            return self.override_value
        return value


# Example Usage
def high_risk_condition(context):
    return context["risk_score"] > 0.7

original_value = 1500
context = {"risk_score": 0.8}  # Example context where risk score is high

override_node = OverrideNode(override_value=2000, condition=high_risk_condition)
final_value = override_node.apply_override(original_value, context)
print(f"Final Value after Override: {final_value}")

In this example, the OverrideNode checks if the customer is high-risk. If the high_risk_condition is met, the OverrideNode overrides the original premium from 1500 to 2000.

3. ABTestNode

Definition:

The ABTestNode is used to run A/B testing within the pricing model, allowing the framework to test two or more pricing strategies simultaneously. Each group in the test receives a different configuration or adjustment, and the results can be analyzed to identify the optimal strategy.

Purpose:

Experiment with Pricing Strategies: Test different premium adjustment methods to see which yields better results (e.g., customer retention or revenue).

Data-driven Decisions: Gather data on the effectiveness of various pricing rules or discount strategies to make informed adjustments.


Example Code:

import random

class ABTestNode:
    """
    Represents an A/B testing node to test different pricing strategies.

    Attributes:
        groups (dict): A dictionary where keys are group names and values are functions that apply adjustments.
    """

    def __init__(self, groups):
        self.groups = groups

    def apply_test(self, base_premium):
        """
        Randomly assigns a customer to a test group and applies the corresponding adjustment.

        Args:
            base_premium (float): The original premium before adjustments.

        Returns:
            tuple: The final premium after A/B test adjustment and the group assigned.
        """
        # Randomly select a group
        selected_group = random.choice(list(self.groups.keys()))
        adjusted_premium = self.groups[selected_group](base_premium)
        return adjusted_premium, selected_group


# Define different strategies for A/B test groups
def strategy_A(base_premium):
    return base_premium * 0.9  # 10% discount

def strategy_B(base_premium):
    return base_premium * 0.95 + 50  # 5% discount + fixed admin fee

# Initialize the A/B test node with two groups
ab_test_node = ABTestNode(groups={"A": strategy_A, "B": strategy_B})

# Example Usage
base_premium = 1000
final_premium, assigned_group = ab_test_node.apply_test(base_premium)
print(f"Final Premium after A/B Test ({assigned_group}): {final_premium}")

In this example:

Group A: Applies a 10% discount on the base premium.

Group B: Applies a 5% discount and adds a fixed admin fee of 50.

The ABTestNode randomly assigns the customer to either Group A or Group B and applies the respective adjustment.


Summary of Each Node:

1. MachineLearningServerNode:

Purpose: Retrieve predictions from a machine learning server.

Use Case: Used for predicting risk scores that adjust the premium based on model predictions.

Example: MachineLearningServerNode connected to a model server for risk prediction.



2. OverrideNode:

Purpose: Override values based on specific conditions.

Use Case: Adjust premiums for special cases, like high-risk customers, by overriding values.

Example: Overrides a premium based on a high-risk condition.



3. ABTestNode:

Purpose: Conduct A/B testing with different pricing strategies.

Use Case: Evaluate which pricing strategy is more effective by assigning customers to different groups.

Example: Applies either a 10% discount or a 5% discount + fee, depending on the test group.




Each node is designed to handle specific types of adjustments, making it easier to add complex logic, conduct experiments, and incorporate machine learning predictions in a structured way.
