### Model Nodes in Photon

Photon's **model nodes** are essential components that facilitate the integration of machine learning models, allowing actuaries and data scientists to build sophisticated pricing and risk assessment solutions. These nodes make use of different machine learning libraries, each chosen to fit specific data types and modeling needs.

---

#### GeneralMLNode: A Versatile Node for Dynamic Model Integration

**Definition**: The **GeneralMLNode** is a flexible node within Photon that supports loading and applying different machine learning models dynamically. These models can include XGBoost, CatBoost, or Scikit-Learn, offering flexibility to switch models based on configuration.

**Purpose**: This node is ideal for risk scoring or price prediction tasks, as it allows easy adaptation to different machine learning models without modifying the core architecture. It enables actuaries to test and deploy different models as needed.

**Example**:
```python
class GeneralMLNode(Node):
    def __init__(self, model_name):
        self.model_name = model_name

    def load_model(self):
        if self.model_name == "xgboost":
            import xgboost as xgb
            return xgb.Booster(model_file='xgboost_model.bin')
        elif self.model_name == "catboost":
            from catboost import CatBoostClassifier
            return CatBoostClassifier().load_model('catboost_model.cbm')
        elif self.model_name == "sklearn":
            import joblib
            return joblib.load('sklearn_model.pkl')

    def predict(self, features):
        model = self.load_model()
        return model.predict(features)

# Example usage:
node = GeneralMLNode(model_name="xgboost")
features = {"age": 30, "vehicle_value": 25000}
prediction = node.predict(features)
```
In this example, the node is configured to load and use an XGBoost model, making predictions based on the given features.

---

#### XGBoost Node: High-Precision Predictions for Structured Data

**Definition**: The **XGBoost Node** integrates with the XGBoost library to use its gradient boosting algorithms for structured data. This node is well-suited for calculating risk scores and adjusting premiums.

**Purpose**: XGBoost is particularly effective for complex models that require high accuracy on structured datasets, such as customer attributes and policy details.

**Example**:
```python
import xgboost as xgb

class XGBoostNode(Node):
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.model_path = model_path

    def load_model(self):
        return xgb.Booster(model_file=self.model_path)

    def predict(self, features):
        dmatrix = xgb.DMatrix(features)
        model = self.load_model()
        return model.predict(dmatrix)

# Example usage:
xgboost_node = XGBoostNode(model_path='xgboost_model.bin')
features = {"age": 25, "vehicle_value": 30000}
risk_score = xgboost_node.predict(features)
```
This example illustrates loading an XGBoost model and using it to predict a risk score for an insurance policyholder.

---

#### CatBoost Node: Optimized for Handling Categorical Data

**Definition**: The **CatBoost Node** uses the CatBoost library, which is optimized for handling categorical data effectively. It allows categorical data, such as customer demographics, to be included without extensive preprocessing.

**Purpose**: The CatBoost Node is helpful for scenarios where pricing models depend on attributes like occupation, location, or marital status, which are typically categorical in nature.

**Example**:
```python
from catboost import CatBoostClassifier

class CatBoostNode(Node):
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.model_path = model_path

    def load_model(self):
        model = CatBoostClassifier()
        model.load_model(self.model_path)
        return model

    def predict(self, features):
        model = self.load_model()
        return model.predict(features)

# Example usage:
catboost_node = CatBoostNode(model_path='catboost_model.cbm')
features = {"occupation": "engineer", "location": "urban"}
premium_adjustment = catboost_node.predict(features)
```
In this example, a CatBoost model is loaded to determine how a customer's occupation and location may affect their insurance premium.

#### Scikit-Learn Node: Simple, Interpretable Models for Classification and Regression

**Definition**: The **Scikit-Learn Node** is designed to integrate models from the Scikit-Learn library. This node is suitable for tasks that require simple, interpretable models, such as binary classification and linear regression.

**Purpose**: Scikit-Learn Node is used for customer segmentation or other tasks that require transparency in model predictions. It is often applied for scenarios requiring easy-to-understand outcomes.

**Example**:
```python
import joblib

class ScikitLearnNode(Node):
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.model_path = model_path

    def load_model(self):
        return joblib.load(self.model_path)

    def predict(self, features):
        model = self.load_model()
        return model.predict([features])

# Example usage:
sklearn_node = ScikitLearnNode(model_path='sklearn_model.pkl')
features = [40, 18000]  # Age, vehicle value
classification = sklearn_node.predict(features)
```
This example demonstrates loading a Scikit-Learn model and classifying a customer as high-risk or low-risk based on given features.

---

#### MachineLearningPickleNode: Custom Model Integration Using Pickle Files

**Definition**: The **MachineLearningPickleNode** allows custom models, saved as pickle files, to be integrated into Photon. This node provides flexibility for loading models that do not belong to mainstream machine learning libraries.

**Purpose**: MachineLearningPickleNode is used when insurers have developed in-house models or proprietary algorithms that need to be incorporated into Photon without modifying the source code significantly.

**Example**:
```python
import pickle

class MachineLearningPickleNode(Node):
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.model_path = model_path

    def load_model(self):
        with open(self.model_path, "rb") as f:
            model = pickle.load(f)
        return model

    def predict(self, features):
        model = self.load_model()
        return model.predict([features])

# Example usage:
pickle_node = MachineLearningPickleNode(model_path='custom_model.pkl')
features = [28, 1, 1, 18000]  # Age, marital status, claim history, vehicle value
premium_estimate = pickle_node.predict(features)
```
Here, a custom model is loaded from a `.pkl` file and used to predict a premium estimate based on multiple features related to the customer and the policy.

number_of_claims_node = InputNode(name="number_of_claims", value=1)
region_node = InputNode(name="region", value="Urban")
```

##### Step 2: Machine Learning Nodes

# Assume we have pre-trained CatBoost and XGBoost models
catboost_model = CatBoostRegressor()
xgboost_model = XGBRegressor()

# Load pre-trained models from files (skipping actual load code for brevity)
# catboost_model.load_model('catboost_model_path')
# xgboost_model.load_model('xgboost_model_path')

# CatBoost Node to predict accident risk score based on vehicle type and age
catboost_node = MLModelNode(catboost_model)
catboost_features = [age_node.execute(), vehicle_type_node.execute() == "SUV"]  # SUV as binary input
accident_risk_score = catboost_node.predict(catboost_features)

# XGBoost Node to predict theft risk score based on region and vehicle type
xgboost_node = MLModelNode(xgboost_model)
xgboost_features = [region_node.execute() == "Urban", vehicle_type_node.execute() == "SUV"]  # Urban and SUV as binary inputs
theft_risk_score = xgboost_node.predict(xgboost_features)
```

##### Step 3: Coefficients and Calculations
Calculate the adjusted premium using the ML risk scores and apply additional coefficients for loyalty and region.

```python
class CoefficientNode:
    """
    Represents a node that adjusts a value based on a coefficient.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the coefficient.

        """
        return value * self.coefficient


# Step 3.1: Apply risk score adjustments to base premium
# Using accident risk and theft risk scores from ML models to adjust premium
risk_adjustment_node = CoefficientNode(name="risk_adjustment", coefficient=1 + (accident_risk_score + theft_risk_score) / 10)
adjusted_premium = risk_adjustment_node.apply(base_premium_node.execute())

# Step 3.2: Apply Loyalty Discount
# Loyalty coefficient is based on years with the insurer (e.g., 1% discount per year)
loyalty_discount_coefficient = max(1 - (years_with_insurer_node.execute() * 0.01), 0.8)  # Maximum 20% discount
loyalty_discount_node = CoefficientNode(name="loyalty_discount", coefficient=loyalty_discount_coefficient)
adjusted_premium_with_loyalty = loyalty_discount_node.apply(adjusted_premium)

# Step 3.3: Apply Regional Coefficient
# Regional coefficients are based on risk factors associated with regions
region_coefficients = {"Urban": 1.2, "Rural": 0.9}
regional_coefficient_value = region_coefficients[region_node.execute()]
regional_coefficient_node = CoefficientNode(name="regional_coefficient", coefficient=regional_coefficient_value)
final_premium = regional_coefficient_node.apply(adjusted_premium_with_loyalty)

print(f"Final Premium with Bonus-Malus System and ML Adjustment: {final_premium}")
```

##### Step 4: Example Output
```
Final Premium with Bonus-Malus System and ML Adjustment: 2100.0  # Example value
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Nodes**:
   - Gather initial values for base premium, age, vehicle type, loyalty, and region.
   
2. **Machine Learning Risk Score Predictions**:
   - Use **CatBoost** to predict an **accident risk score** based on vehicle type and age.
   - Use **XGBoost** to predict a **theft risk score** based on region and vehicle type.
   
3. **Coefficient Applications**:
   - **Risk Adjustment**: Combine accident and theft risk scores to adjust the premium.
   - **Loyalty Discount**: Apply a loyalty-based coefficient that reduces the premium according to how many years the customer has stayed.
   - **Regional Adjustment**: Apply a regional coefficient to account for the risk associated with living in an urban or rural area.

### Summary
This use case highlights the complexity that Photon can handle by combining multiple types of nodes:
- **Machine Learning Models (CatBoost & XGBoost)** are used for making predictions that directly influence the pricing calculations.
- **Arithmetic Calculations and Coefficients**: Calculations such as loyalty discounts and regional adjustments showcase how Photon can manage diverse adjustments based on different inputs.

### Benefits of This Approach
1. **Scalability**: The model can easily be extended to include more features or coefficients.
2. **Transparency**: Each adjustment to the premium is modular, making it easy to track and explain to both developers and stakeholders.
3. **Automation**: Using machine learning models to predict risk factors enables automated adjustments based on changing customer data, enhancing real-time pricing capabilities.

This example shows how Photon can manage a more sophisticated premium calculation that goes beyond simple arithmetic, involving machine learning predictions, multiple coefficient adjustments, and dynamic conditions based on customer data.
